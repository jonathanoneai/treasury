These boots served as both another Chanel collaboration and a political statement. Featured on the boots are sayings such as "Don't Same The World," "Change," "Your Time," and "Human Connection" alongside a Chanel logo painted on the right toe. 

The red Timberland 6-inch waterproof black nubuck boot features hand-painted motifs and was worn by Pharrell when he was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. </p></div><div

(“Joopiter”) for the Private Sale, you accept and agree to be bound by these Conditions of Private Sale, which constitute your entire agreement with Joopiter. These Conditions govern the rights and obligations of all potential buyers who register for the Private Sale (“Registered Buyers”).\n\n2. __Joopiter’s Role.__ Most of the time, the Seller is the owner of the lot. Joopiter includes a TRIANGLE symbol ∆ in the lot description indicating that Joopiter or one of its principals is the owner of the lot or has an ownership interest in the lot.\n\n3. __Offering Prices.__ For each lot, an Offering Price that has been determined in consultation with the Seller will be provided “on request” upon inquiry from a Registered Buyer. An Offering Price is an opinion of the price at which an object should sell at a Private Sale.\n\n4. __Viewing.__ Although it is not always possible to arrange, please contact Joopiter if you wish to view any lot in person. Descriptions of lots and images are not warranties. Lots are sold “as is.”\n\n5. __Condition, etc.: “As Is.”__ Joopiter guarantees (a) the authenticity of the lot to the extent described in the Authenticity Guarantee (see § 12 below), and (b) that you will receive good title to the lot to the extent required by law. OTHERWISE, YOU AGREE THAT EACH LOT IS SOLD “AS IS” AND IN THE CONDITION THAT IT IS IN AT THE TIME OF THE PRIVATE SALE. NEITHER JOOPITER NOR THE SELLER MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CORRECTNESS OF THE CATALOGUE OR OTHER IMAGES, OR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITION, SIZE, QUALITY, RARITY, COLOR, IMPORTANCE, MEDIUM, FRAME, PROVENANCE, EXHIBITIONS, LITERATURE, OR HISTORICAL RELEVANCE OF ANY LOT. No statement anywhere, whether oral or written, whether made in the catalogue, an advertisement, a bill of sale, online, or elsewhere, can be relied on by you or others to be a warranty, representation, or shall give rise to the liability of Joopiter or the Seller. Images, descriptions, and condition reports are not meant to be complete or a substitute for assessing the condition of the lot yourself or through an agent you may engage; they are for guidance only. Nothing in any written or oral descriptions of a lot constitutes a representation of fact; they represent the opinions held by Joopiter based on the information it has.\n\n6. __Minimum Price Required by Seller.__ Unless Joopiter specifically states otherwise in writing, no lot will be sold for less than a confidential price determined in the Seller’s sole discretion. Until you (as a potential purchaser) and Joopiter reach an Agreed Purchase Price (defined below), any lot may be sold to another Registered Buyer or withdrawn without prior notice to you. \n\n7. __Agreed Purchase Price.__ A lot will only be sold to you when you and Joopiter unequivocally agree *__in writing__* to (a) a specific, final price for the lot (excluding taxes, shipping, and other charges) (the “Agreed Purchase Price”) and (b) payment terms. You agree that your accepted offer to pay the Agreed Purchase Price is final and cannot be revoked by you.\n\n8. __No Buyer’s Premium.__ No buyer’s premium will be charged or collected by Joopiter.\n\n9. __Registering to Make Offers and Purchase.__ When accessing a Joopiter platform, you must either log in to your Joopiter account or create an account if you do not already have one. You may then make offers to purchase lots subject to these Conditions of Sale once the Private Sale has opened. Joopiter reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse your participation before, during, or after the sale.\n\n10. __Withdrawal; Cancellation.__ Joopiter reserves the right to cancel a Private Sale and to withdraw any lot before, during, or after the sale; we shall have no liability whatsoever for such cancellation or withdrawal.\n\n11. __Registered Buyers.__ By participating in the Private Sale, you represent, warrant, and agree that:\n\n  a. Neither you individually nor—if “you” are a company or other entity—any person who owns, partly owns, or controls the company or entity, are subject to trade sanctions, embargoes, or any other restriction on trade in the jurisdiction in which you or it does business, as well as under the laws of the European Union, the laws of England and Wales, or the laws and regulations of the United States (collectively, “Sanctioned Person(s)”);\n\n  b. Where acting as agent (with Joopiter’s prior written consent), your principal is not a Sanctioned Person(s), nor owned (in whole or in part) by a Sanctioned Person(s), nor controlled by a Sanctioned Person(s);\n\n  c. None of the Agreed Purchase Price will be funded by any Sanctioned Person(s), nor will any party involved in the transaction, including, but not limited to, financial institutions, freight forwarders or other forwarding agents, or any other party, be a Sanctioned Person(s), nor owned (in whole or in part) by a Sanctioned Person(s), nor controlled by a Sanctioned Person(s), unless such activity is authorized in writing by the government authority having jurisdiction over the transaction or in applicable law or regulation; and\n\n  d. You are financially sound and know when and how you will pay for the lot if your offer to purchase the lot at an Agreed Purchase Price is accepted by Joopiter.\n\nIt is Joopiter’s policy to request a government issued identification containing a photograph, such as a passport, identity card, or driver’s license in order for you to register to be accepted by Joopiter as a Registered Buyer. Joopiter will use this information to verify your identification and screen for regulatory and financial risk. Additionally, Joopiter will conduct a World-Check check for screening and due diligence purposes. Please review Joopiter’s Privacy policy located at https://www.joopiter.com/concierge?slug=privacy-policy and the World-Check Privacy Statement located at https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/world-check-kyc-screening/privacy-statement regarding the processing of your information and your rights.\n\n12. __Authenticity Guarantee.__ Joopiter guarantees that the description of a lot that appears in italic letters with the first letter of each word capitalized (for example, *White Gold Diamond Drop Earrings*) is accurate. This guarantee is provided to the original purchaser for a period of four (4) years from the date of the Private Sale, is solely for the benefit of the original purchaser of record at the Private Sale, and may not be transferred to any third party.\n\nTo make a claim under the Authenticity Guarantee, a Registered Buyer who has continuously owned the lot (i.e., the original purchaser, not a subsequent transferee) must:\n\n  a. Within 90 days of becoming aware of any information that casts any doubt on the accuracy of the description of a lot that appears in italic letters with the first letter of each word capitalized, provide us with the details of such information and all related documentation;\n\n  b. Return the lot to us in the same condition as at the closing date of the sale and be able to transfer good title to the lot, free of any third-party claims arising after the date of such sale; and\n\n  c. Provide Joopiter with reports regarding the accuracy of the description of a lot that appears in *italic* letters with the first letter of each word capitalized from at least two (2) independent, qualified, and recognized experts, who are reasonably acceptable to Joopiter in its discretion.\nJoopiter has the sole discretion to waive any of the above requirements but must do so in writing.\nYou agree and understand that the rescission of a sale and the refund of the original purchase price paid pursuant to this Authenticity Guarantee (and or for any other claims you may have) is your sole remedy and in lieu of any other remedy which might otherwise be available to you, including as against the Seller. Neither Joopiter nor Seller shall be liable for any special, punitive, incidental, consequential, or other damages incurred or claimed including, but not limited to, lost profits, or interest.\n\n__Other Information that Registered Buyers May Find Useful__\n\nPlease note that all weights and sizes are approximate, whether or not they are qualified as such. Photographs are often not actual size and should not be taken as indicative of a jewelry piece or gemston's actual size. When Joopiter has gemological reports, Joopiter may make them available but cannot guarantee their accuracy as some laboratories assess gemstones differently and report different results based on testing methods. It is not uncommon for colored gemstones to have been treated (e.g., with heat or oil) to enhance their appearance but it is not possible for Joopiter to determine whether any of the lots including gemstones have been treated.\n\nJoopiter is aware of the connection between \"conflict diamonds\" and the link between diamonds sourced in certain regions and violent conflict. Joopiter will not knowingly sell any diamonds that it knows to have been sourced from regions identified by the United Nations as sources of conflict diamonds.\n\n13. __Record of Sale.__ The record of sale kept by Joopiter is absolute and final in all disputes. In the event of a discrepancy between any online records or messages provided to you and the record of sale kept by Joopiter, the record of sale will govern.\n\n14. __Obligations of Registered Buyers in the Event an Agreed Purchase Price is Reached.__ Subject only to these Conditions of Sale, Joopiter’s agreement in writing to an Agreed Purchase Price and payment terms establishes a binding contract with the Registered Buyer. Joopiter will email an invoice in the name of, and with the address registered for the Registered Buyer, which cannot be transferred to other accounts, names, or addresses without Joopiter’s explicit agreement in writing.\n\n  a. __Payment.__ Unless otherwise agreed by Joopiter in writing, the Registered Buyer must pay the full Agreed Purchase Price invoiced (including applicable tax, and other amounts due), so that it is received by Joopiter within five (5) business days of the date of the invoice. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all payments will be made by wire transfer.\n\n  b. __Tax.__ Unless exempted by law, the purchaser will be required to pay the applicable state and local sales tax and/or duties on the Agreed Purchase Price, regardless of the state or country in which the purchaser resides or does business. If the lot is delivered to a state where Joopiter is not required to collect sales tax, it is the responsibility of the Registered Buyer to self-assess any sales or use tax and remit it to the taxing authorities in that state.\n\n  c. __Title.__ Title to, and right to possess, a lot will not pass until Joopiter has received the full Agreed Purchase Price in good, cleared funds and received Seller’s confirmation of receipt of the applicable sale proceeds. Joopiter is not obligated to release a lot to the Registered Buyer unless she, he, or they have paid the full Agreed Purchase Price (inclusive of taxes, duties and any other costs identified by Joopiter) and the Seller has confirmed receipt of the applicable sale proceeds.\n\n  d. __Collection of Property.__ Unless otherwise agreed to in writing with Joopiter, Registered Buyers must arrange for the lot to be delivered to them, at their expense, within 30 days of the Private Sale. Joopiter and the Seller’s liability for loss or damage to the lot shall cease upon the earlier of (i) 30 calendar days after the Private Sale or (ii) the release of the lot to you or a designated agent nominated by you and agreed to, and verified by, Joopiter in its sole discretion.\n\n  e. __Exports and Permits.__ It is the Registered Buyer’s sole responsibility to identify and obtain any necessary export, import, or other permit for the lot. Any information in the lot description reflect Joopiter’s reasonable opinion at the time of publication and are for Registered Buyers’ general guidance only. Joopiter and the Seller make no representations or warranties as to whether any lot is or is not subject to export or import restrictions or any embargoes.\n\n__Joopiter’s Obligations.__\n\n  a. __Data Protection.__ Joopiter will hold and process your personal information and may share it with its third-party service providers for use as described in, and in line with, Joopiter’s Privacy Policy, published on its website at https://www.joopiter.com/concierge?slug=privacy-policy or available on request by email to concierge@joopiter.com. Additionally, as the Private Sales will be conducted via Basta Ventures ehf. (“Basta”), your information will be processed by Basta in accordance with its Privacy Policy located at https://www.basta.ai. Under European data protection laws, you may object, by request and free of charge, to the processing of your information for certain purposes, including direct marketing, you may access and rectify personal data relating to you, and may obtain more information about Joopiter’s data protection policies by writing to Joopiter at concierge@joopiter.com.\n\n  b. __EU CONSUMER RIGHTS DIRECTIVE.__ If you are a consumer habitually residing in the European Union and the Seller of the lot you have bought is not a consumer, you have the right under the EU Consumer Rights Directive to cancel your online purchase within 14 days of the date you collect the lot or it is delivered to you. \n\nIf you qualify for the cancellation right and wish to exercise it, you must notify us in writing within 14 days of the date you collect the lot, or it is delivered to you (“Cancellation Period”). You are considered to have collected a lot if you collect, or someone you authorize, collects the lot on your behalf. Within 14 days of sending us the cancellation notice, you must return the property to us at your own cost in the same condition as when it was collected by or delivered to you. If a lot was delivered to you, you should use the same shipping method that was used to deliver the lot to you to return the lot. You must pay all return shipping costs, including any applicable import and customs fees, charges and taxes, and answer for any loss or damage to the lot incurred after it was released to you.\n\nUpon receiving the lot, and provided it is in the same condition as when the lot was collected by or delivered to you, we will reimburse the Purchase Price you paid (less any deductions for loss in value of the Property due to your actions or those of one or more of your agents) by the same means that you used to pay the invoice.\n\n16. __Joopiter’s Rights.__\n\n  a. __Concerns about Funds.__ Joopiter has the right to refuse to accept payment if, in its sole discretion, it has concerns about the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties above, payment comes from a source other than the Registered Buyer identified by Joopiter as the purchaser of record, or if it believes that accepting the payment would be unlawful or may subject Joopiter to any liability.\n\n  b. __Unmet Payment Obligations.__ Without prejudice to any rights the Seller may have, if you fail to pay the full Agreed Purchase Price (including applicable tax and other amounts due) for a lot in good, cleared funds within five (5) days of the close of the Private Sale, we may in our sole discretion exercise one or more of the following remedies:\n\n  i. Cancel the sale of the lot, retaining any partial payment as liquidated damages;\n\n  ii. Charge interest at 12% per annum from the date payment became due until the date the full Agreed Purchase Price, plus applicable tax and other amounts due, is received in cleared funds;\n\n  iii. Resell the lot in any commercially reasonable manner, it being understood that in the event such resale is for less than the Agreed Purchase Price and other amounts due for the sale that lot, the initial Registered Buyer will remain liable for the shortfall together with all costs incurred in connection with such resale;\n\n  iv. Commence legal proceedings to recover the Agreed Purchase Price and other amounts due for that lot, together with interest, reasonable attorney’s fees, and the costs of such proceedings;\n\n  v. Set off the outstanding amount remaining unpaid by the Registered Buyer against any amounts which we may owe the applicable tax and other amounts due in any other transactions; and/or \n\n  vi. Release information about the applicable tax and other amounts due sufficient to enable the Seller to recover the amounts due from the Private Sale, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, in legal proceedings or otherwise.\n\n17. __Resolving Disputes.__ We hope never to have any disputes with you but, if we do, we will first try to resolve it amicably if we (in our sole discretion) believe that we reasonably can. If we do not resolve the dispute, this section contains the important terms to which you and other Registered Buyers agree by participating in the Private Sale.\n\n  a. __Governing Law and Jurisdiction.__ These Conditions of Sale, as well as the Registered Buyer’s, and our respective rights and obligations hereunder, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located in the State of California.\n\n  b. __Limitation of Liability.__ Under no circumstances shall the aggregate liability of Joopiter and the Seller to a purchaser exceed the amount of the Agreed Purchase Price actually paid.  Joopiter will not be liable for any errors or failures to accept and close on a Registered Buyer’s offer to purchase a lot, including due any errors or failures caused by (i) a loss of connection to the internet or the Joopiter’s online platform by either Joopiter or a Registered Buyer; (ii) a breakdown or problem with Joopiter’s online platform software; (iii) a breakdown or problem with a Registered Buyer’s Internet connection, mobile network, or computer; (iv) miscommunications; or (v) Seller’s withdrawal of a lot.\n\n  c. __Allocation of Dispute Costs.__ The prevailing party—you or we as determined by the court—will be entitled to recover the costs of the dispute, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs, plus interest at the rate authorized by the law of California.\n\n18. __Conditions are Frequently Updated.__ Joopiter periodically, including during a sale, updates and makes changes to these Conditions of Sale. While we do not send out notices to you when we do so, you can check the most-current Conditions of Private Sale by going to the [Terms of Sale](https://www.joopiter.com/concierge?slug=terms-of-sale \"Terms of Sale\") page at [https://www.joopiter.com/concierge?slug=terms-of-sale](https://www.joopiter.com/concierge?slug=terms-of-sale \"Terms of Sale\").
